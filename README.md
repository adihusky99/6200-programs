# 6200-Assignment 1
This Readme file describes the programs for assignment 1. The program names are calc_daltons.py, calc_number_amino_acids.py, dynamic_protocol.py
1. calc_daltons.py:  program calculates the estimated molecular weight of the protein in kilodaltons and writes the result on the screen. Program also involves hardcoding in the protein sequence and assigning it to a variable
2. calc_number_amino_acids.py: program should then calculate the number of amino acids in the resulting protein and its estimated molecular weight in kilodaltons after the user inputs the gene name and the number of nucleotides the gene contains
3. dynamic_protocol.py: program gets data from the user to determine the amount of NaCl and MgCl is required to make a certain volume of the final solution.
